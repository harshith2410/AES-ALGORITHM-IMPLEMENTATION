# AES-ALGORITHM-IMPLEMENTATION
Encryption and decryption programs written in C++

File Details:-


encrypt.cpp - Source file for encryption utility.
decrypt.cpp - Source file for decryption utility.
structures.h - Provides the structures and Key Expansion functions for use in the main program files.

To implement console based application for encrypting and decrypting the obj file which is given . AES uses symmetric key encryption, which involves the use of only one secret key to cipher and decipher information.The algorithm used here is AES algorithm and process needs to be performed with multi-threading process using C++.
